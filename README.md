# Virtual-Assistant
This project showcases a custom-built robot that enables real-time interaction between a laptop and an Arduino-controlled robotic system. The robot is designed for multi-functional use cases such as object detection, voice-controlled navigation, and real-time data feedback through a laptop interface.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Arduino-MCU Integration: Powered by Arduino UNO/Nano to control motors and sensors.

Laptop Communication: Uses serial communication (USB or Bluetooth) to interact with the laptop in real-time.

Voice Command Support: Accepts voice inputs through the laptop to control the robot's movement and functions.

Sensor Monitoring: Equipped with ultrasonic and IR sensors for obstacle detection and distance monitoring.

Real-Time Feedback: Data from sensors is displayed and logged on the laptop for monitoring and debugging.

AI Compatibility (Optional Extension): Can be extended to include camera module (ESP32-CAM) for AI-based object detection or surveillance tasks.

ðŸ§  Tech Stack:

Arduino IDE (C/C++)

Python (for serial communication & voice processing)

PySerial, SpeechRecognition libraries

Optional: OpenCV for computer vision features

ðŸ“Œ Applications:

Educational Robotics

Home Surveillance

Voice-controlled IoT Devices

Remote Inspection Bots
